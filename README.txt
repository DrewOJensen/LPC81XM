LPC81XM TSSOP20

Cadsoft Eagle Library for NXP's LPC81XM line, also known as Cortex M0+, only in the TSSOP20 package. Feel free to branch and add packages and extend past the LPC81XM line. If branching and committing, please keep it within the NXP LPC800 line.

I've also attached the calculations for the pad placement for recreation or alterations along with a URL for the processing of creating a device for Cadsoft Eagle.
